z# Copilot Instructions for Movie Library Electron App

## Project Architecture (Language Learning + Advanced FSRS + AI Integration)

### Big Picture Architecture
- **Electron Main Process** (`src/main/main.ts`): Handles window creation, IPC (file dialogs, ffmpeg, Ollama AI), menu, and service bridging. IPC methods are typed in `preload.ts`.
- **Renderer Process**: React 19 app (`src/renderer/App.tsx`) with modular UI, React Router (`MemoryRouter`), and Golden Layout for multi-pane movie details. Navigation via `useParams`/`useNavigate`.
- **PocketBase Backend**: Self-hosted DB (`pocketbase/pocketbase`), stores movies, flashcards, review logs. All DB ops via `src/lib/services/pocketbase.ts` (typed, advanced FSRS scheduling with mastery sessions).
- **Ollama AI Integration**: Local service (`localhost:11434`), IPC bridge for translation/AI chat. Main/renderer communicate via service layer.

### Developer Workflows
- **Start Backend**: `./pocketbase/pocketbase serve` (must run before frontend)
- **Start Frontend**: `npm run start` (hot reload, electronmon)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (webpack config in `.erb/configs/`)
- **Package**: `npm run package` (electron-builder)

### Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Type Safety**: All DB/service methods typed in `src/lib/types/database.ts`
- **Service Layer**: All DB/AI/IPC logic in `src/lib/services/` and `src/main/ollama-service.ts`
- **Advanced FSRS**: Comprehensive spaced repetition with mastery sessions, skip functionality, and intelligent card grouping via `ts-fsrs` (dynamic import)
- **Golden Layout**: Multi-pane UI in `MovieDetails` (`src/components/layout/GoldenLayoutWrapper.tsx`)
- **Modern Dialog Design**: Two-column CSS Grid layouts, glassmorphism styling, responsive animations
- **Video/Subtitle**: `VideoPreview` and `VideoPlayer` handle aspect ratio, repeat, subtitle delay, keyboard nav
- **Translation**: Text selection → `TranslateButton` → `TranslationModal` (Bing iframe)
- **AI Chat**: `AiChatPanel` for Ollama-powered chat, context-aware, model selection
- **Glassmorphism Theme**: Backdrop-blur, gradients, sharp edges (no border-radius), CSS custom properties for dynamic styling

### Integration Points
- **IPC**: All file/AI ops via typed IPC in `preload.ts`, exposed via contextBridge
- **PocketBase**: Must be running for all persistence; flashcard scheduling, mastery tracking, progress analytics
- **FFmpeg**: Required for thumbnail extraction (main process)
- **Ollama**: Local AI service for translation/learning
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@/` for absolute imports (webpack config)

### Study Session Features (Advanced FSRS Implementation)
- **Mastery Sessions**: Continue until all cards reach configurable stability thresholds (7-91 days)
- **Smart Card Grouping**: Due status (overdue/today/soon), FSRS state (new/learning/review/relearning), difficulty-based groups
- **Session Types**: Standard (fixed count) vs Mastery (until threshold met)
- **Skip Functionality**: Shared navigation logic between review and skip actions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time mastery progress, session analytics, rating distribution
- **Intelligent Progression**: Non-random card ordering for mastery sessions, proper state synchronization

### Examples
- **Add Movie**: Select video, auto-extract thumbnail, store in DB
- **Create Flashcard**: Extract subtitle segment, preview video, edit markdown notes, schedule with FSRS
- **Study Sessions**: Choose group (due cards, difficulty-based), configure mastery thresholds, review with 4-button FSRS rating
- **Mastery Mode**: Continue reviewing until cards reach stability threshold, track progress in real-time
- **Translate Text**: Select subtitle, open translation modal, swap languages
- **AI Chat**: Ask grammar/translation questions, context-aware, model selection

## Database Integration (PocketBase + Advanced FSRS)
- **Service Layer**: `src/lib/services/pocketbase.ts` handles all database operations with typed methods including comprehensive FSRS flashcard scheduling and mastery tracking
- **Type Safety**: `src/lib/types/database.ts` defines `MovieRecord`, `FlashcardRecord`, `CreateFlashcardData`, `FSRSState`, `FSRSRating`, `SessionConfig` types
- **Movie Schema**: `{ title, mp4_path, srt_path?, srt_delay, last_position, duration?, thumbnail?, date_added, last_accessed }`
- **Flashcard Schema**: `{ movie_id, subtitle_text, free_space (markdown), start_time, end_time, FSRS fields (due, stability, difficulty, reps, lapses, learning_steps, state, last_review) }`
- **FSRS Integration**: Uses `ts-fsrs` library for spaced repetition scheduling with dynamic imports to avoid CommonJS/ESM conflicts
- **Mastery Tracking**: Configurable stability thresholds (7-91 days), state requirements (Review/any), difficulty limits for mastery determination

## Core Movie + Learning + AI Features
- **Library Management**: Add movies by selecting video files, auto-extract thumbnails using ffmpeg spawn processes
- **Subtitle Support**: SRT parsing with custom delay adjustment, position controls (on-screen/below), keyboard navigation (1/2 keys), repeat functionality for language learning
- **Watch Progress**: Resume functionality with automatic position saving, debounced database updates
- **Flashcard Creation**: Extract subtitle segments into flashcards with video preview, timing adjustment, and markdown notes
- **Advanced Study Sessions**: Two session types - Standard (fixed count) and Mastery (continue until threshold)
- **Smart Card Grouping**: Due status (overdue/today/soon), FSRS state-based, difficulty-based groups with color coding and priority sorting
- **Mastery Mode**: Configurable stability thresholds (7-91 days), real-time progress tracking, intelligent card progression
- **Skip Functionality**: Shared navigation logic allows skipping cards in study sessions
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review flashcards using FSRS algorithm with 4-button rating system (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
- **Translation Integration**: Bing Translator iframe widgets, text selection for translation, fullscreen translation modal
- **AI Language Assistant**: Ollama-powered chat panel for German-English translation, grammar explanations, and contextual language learning support

## Advanced UI Patterns & Modern Design
- **Golden Layout**: Multi-pane interface in MovieDetails using `golden-layout` library with video player, AI chat, subtitles/translations, and flashcards panels
- **Modern Dialog Design**: StudySessionDialog features glassmorphism styling, responsive grid layouts, fade/slide animations
- **Two-Column Layouts**: AddFlashcardDialog uses CSS Grid layout - left column (video preview, timing controls, subtitle), right column (markdown editor for notes)
- **Session Type Selection**: Toggle between Standard and Mastery sessions with visual indicators and descriptions
- **Mastery Configuration**: Range slider with CSS custom properties for progress visualization, threshold labels (7d-91d)
- **Card Group Grid**: 3-column responsive grid with color-coded groups, hover effects, selection states
- **Quick Count Selection**: Buttons for common card counts (5, 10, 20, 50, All) with active state styling
- **Session Preview**: Real-time preview of session configuration with estimated time calculations
- **Reusable Components**: VideoPreview component with dynamic aspect ratio detection, repeat functionality, and time-bound playback
- **Translation Flow**: Text selection → TranslateButton → TranslationModal with language swapping and Bing iframe integration
- **AI Chat Integration**: Real-time Ollama chat panel with context awareness, model selection, and specialized German translation prompts
- **Glassmorphism Theme**: Consistent backdrop-blur, gradients, sharp edges (no border-radius), CSS custom properties for dynamic styling

## Developer Workflows
- **Start Backend**: `./pocketbase/pocketbase serve` (starts database on :8090, must run first)
- **Start Frontend**: `npm run start` (webpack dev server with hot reload for renderer + electronmon for main)
- **Full Development**: Run PocketBase then npm start concurrently (backend dependency critical)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (builds main + renderer via webpack config in `.erb/configs/`)
- **Package**: `npm run package` (electron-builder with asset bundling)

## IPC Communication Patterns
- **File System**: `openVideoFile()`, `openSubtitleFile()`, `readSubtitleFile()`, `fileExists()` - all async/await
- **Video Processing**: `extractVideoFrames(videoPath, count)` spawns ffmpeg, returns `{ frames: string[], duration: number }`
- **Ollama AI Bridge**: `ollama-is-available`, `ollama-list-models`, `ollama-chat`, `ollama-chat-with-context`, `ollama-translate` for AI integration
- **Type Safety**: All IPC methods typed in `src/main/preload.ts` as `ElectronHandler`, exposed via contextBridge
- **Security**: contextBridge with no nodeIntegration, webSecurity disabled only in dev for local file access

## UI State Management Patterns  
- **React Router Navigation**: `MemoryRouter` with routes `/` (HomeScreen) and `/movie/:id` (MovieDetails). Uses `useParams` and `useNavigate` hooks.
- **Component Communication**: Parent-child props for movie selection (`onPlayMovie`), dialog state management with loading/error patterns
- **Study Session State**: Complex session state including cards, current index, mastery tracking, reviewed cards, session configuration
- **Persistent State**: Video progress auto-saved to PocketBase, flashcard review history tracked with FSRS scheduling, mastery progress persistence
- **Dialog Management**: Multiple dialogs (translation, flashcard creation/viewing, study session) with auto-pause video when opened
- **AI Chat State**: Focus tracking to disable keyboard shortcuts when AI input is active, conversation history persistence
- **Mastery Logic**: Real-time mastery checking, card progression based on FSRS state, threshold-based session completion

## Export/Import Module Patterns
- **UI Components**: Centralized exports in `src/components/ui/index.ts` with mixed default/named patterns
- **Service Singletons**: PocketBase service exported as both named export and default with dynamic FSRS imports
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@/` for absolute imports mapped via webpack config
- **Dynamic Imports**: FSRS library imported dynamically to avoid CommonJS/ESM conflicts: `await import('ts-fsrs')`

## Key Integration Points
- **Advanced FSRS**: Comprehensive spaced repetition with mastery sessions, skip functionality, intelligent card grouping and progression
- **Mastery Sessions**: Configurable stability thresholds, real-time progress tracking, continue-until-mastery logic
- **Golden Layout**: React components rendered in layout panels via `componentId` registration and DOM manipulation
- **Video Synchronization**: VideoPreview component maintains time state, supports aspect ratio detection and repeat functionality
- **Translation Workflow**: Text selection → floating button → modal with Bing iframe, language detection and swapping
- **Markdown Editing**: Custom MarkdownEditor with edit/preview tabs for flashcard notes, integrated in two-column layouts
- **Ollama AI Service**: Main process hosts Ollama client, renderer communicates via IPC with conversation context and model selection
- **Modern CSS Patterns**: CSS custom properties for dynamic styling, responsive design, glassmorphism effects, smooth animations
